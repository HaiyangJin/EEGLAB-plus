# ERP_Data_Analysis
Matlab scripts to analyze ERP data for S2 Duration

 V 1.0 scripts are based on the preProcessing steps in Corblab
 V 2.0 and later versions of scripts are following the [Makoto's preprocessing pipeline](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Makoto%27s_preprocessing_pipeline).

V 1.0 and V 2.0 are backed up in google drive.

Now the codes are in version 3.0. The codes are more in the format of Matlab functions.
